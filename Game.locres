    "DISPATCH_01029": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Get that schematic, and with some luck, you can deactivate that endoskeleton and collect it for us as well.",
    "DISPATCH_01030": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\I can just smell that $25 gift certificate, can't you?",
    "DISPATCH_01031": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\You need to reach Murray's Executive Suite, that's where the schematic most likely is. ",
    "DISPATCH_01032": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Your Data Diver doesn't have executive permission yet, so you can't get anywhere near it.",
    "DISPATCH_01033": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Not a problem, we just need to find stations to upgrade your Data Diver until you can gain access. ",
    "DISPATCH_01034": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\They are all over the facility. In fact, there is a station in the warehouse manager's office. You should head there next.",
    "DISPATCH_01035": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Before you go, take a hand crank for the security fence.",
    "DISPATCH_01040": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Awesome, glad to see you made it here without any complications whatsoever!",
    "DISPATCH_01041": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\So, we did some digging to learn more about that bothersome endoskeleton that keeps relentlessly pursuing you.",
    "DISPATCH_01042": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\From what we can tell, it was designed to keep Murray's son entertained while Murray worked.",
    "DISPATCH_01043": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\It would mimic the actions of those around it.",
    "DISPATCH_01044": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\At some point the endoskeleton was exposed to some sort of violence, the details of which are a little fuzzy.",
    "DISPATCH_01045": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\This 'Mimic' endoskeleton then copied that violent behavior.",
    "DISPATCH_01046": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\We came up with some great ideas on how to protect yourself.",
    "DISPATCH_01047": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Unfortunately, we came up with those ideas before the last technicians were sent in,\\\\\\\\and they ended up with less than positive results.",
    "DISPATCH_01048": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\So, it seems that maybe distraction and avoidance are your best tools,\\\\\\\\as a direct confrontation will likely result in the loss of some limbs. ",
    "DISPATCH_01049": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\The previous technicians considered it an honor to lose limbs in the service of their company,\\\\\\\\and I'm sure they would tell you that themselves if they hadn't died from blood loss.",
    "DISPATCH_01050": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\We expect you'll succeed where they failed. One out of three Fazbear Employees has confidence in you, so go get 'em tiger!",
    "DISPATCH_01051": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\Head back to where you first entered the building for further instructions.",
    "DISPATCH_01052": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\You could have helped. If you had just given me the schematics, we could have fixed things.",
    "DISPATCH_01053": "(DISPATCH)\\\\\\\\I thought you were different. I thought you might understand.",
